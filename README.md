# Minesweeper

An Artificial Intelligence project that focuses on using Inference-Informed Action to create optimal minesweeper solving agents

## Description

This artificial intelligence project is a collection of agents which utilize Inference-Informed Action to solve Minesweeper games. The game state is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix in which each cell is either safe or unsafe. The states change as the user or agent clicks on squares to reveal more information. The improved agents utilise a global knowledge base and constraint equations which allow information from multiple parts of the board to be used together to make a decision.

## Report

The project is fully built in Python with Tkinter, and NumPy. Along with the code in this repository there is also a supporting PDF report that provides in-depth analysis, game visualizations, and efficiency graphs of the project.
